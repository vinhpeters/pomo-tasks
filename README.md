## Pomo what?
PomoTasks is based the on the Pomodoro Technique created by Francesco Cirillo.

"The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student"

## How to use PomoTasks
1. Add tasks.
2. Estimate the number of pomodoros from each task. Break up tasks greater than 5-7 pomodoros.
3. Choose a task to work on.
4. Start the timer and work on the task.
5. After the pomodoro ends, take a short 5 minute break.
6. After every 4 pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break.

The default and recommended times are: 25 min for a pomodoro, 5 min for a short break and 15-30 minutes for a long break. You can always change the time to suit your preferences.
